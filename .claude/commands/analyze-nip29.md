Please analyze the NIP-29 comprehensive group lifecycle test results below and provide a detailed report.

## Test Overview
The test runs through the complete NIP-29 (Relay-based Groups) specification with 28 steps covering:

### Core Functionality
1. Group creation (kind 9007) and state verification (kinds 39000-39003)
2. Metadata editing (kind 9002) with verification
3. Public/private and open/closed group settings
4. User invites (kind 9009) and joins (kind 9021)
5. Member management (kinds 9000, 9001)

### Advanced Features
6. Timeline references (previous event tags)
7. Multiple event kinds (chat messages kind 9, articles kind 30023)
8. Role-based permissions (admin, moderator, member, custom roles)
9. Moderation actions (kind 9005) with deletion verification
10. User leaving (kind 9022) with access verification
11. Late publication prevention
12. Group deletion (kind 9008) with verification

## Key Areas to Analyze

1. **Test Completion**: Did all 28 steps complete successfully?

2. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Look for NIP-42 authentication patterns
   - Note any "Auth required" errors followed by successful AUTH
   - This is expected behavior as `nak` retries with authentication

3. **Group State Management**:
   - Verify 39000-39003 events are created/updated correctly
   - Check metadata updates are reflected properly
   - Ensure member lists are maintained accurately

4. **Access Control**:
   - Step 9: Private group access denial for non-members
   - Step 17: Non-admin metadata edit rejection
   - Step 22: Access denial after user leaves

5. **Deletion Operations** (Critical):
   - Step 19-20: Message deletion and verification
   - Step 27-28: Group deletion and verification
   - Verify proper authorization for deletions

6. **Advanced Features**:
   - Timeline references handling
   - Different event kinds support
   - Role-based permissions enforcement
   - Late publication prevention (step 23)

7. **Error Patterns**:
   - Distinguish between expected errors (auth retries, permission denials) and actual failures
   - Note any unexpected errors or warnings

8. **Performance**: Note any concerning delays or timeouts

## Expected Behavior
- Initial auth errors are normal (nak retries automatically)
- Permission denials for unauthorized actions are expected
- The relay's own pubkey should have special privileges
- All 28 steps should complete (some may show expected failures)
- Deleted content should not be retrievable after deletion
- Access control should be enforced consistently

## Output Format
Please provide:
1. **Overall Verdict**: PASS/FAIL with confidence level
2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Brief status for each of the 28 steps
3. **Key Findings** organized by:
   - ✓ Successes
   - ⚠️ Warnings or concerns
   - ✗ Failures
4. **Feature Verification**:
   - Core NIP-29 compliance
   - Advanced features working correctly
   - Security and access control
5. **Recommendations** if any issues found
